### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After eight years of working in the luxury hospitality industry as a VIP flight crew, I decided to apply my creative problem-solving, people skills and resourcefulness to a new field. As an individual who thrives on change and new challenges, the ever-changing world of technology was hugely appealing, so I decided to retrain as a web developer. After completing an intensive BCS-accredited boot camp, I am now looking for front-end roles in which to apply my creativity and my new technical skills.
